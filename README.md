# Backup Azure Managed Disks to another region with differential capability of incremental snapshots

Incremental snapshots provide differential capability â€“ a unique capability available only in Azure Managed Disks. It enables customers and independent solution vendors (ISV) to build backup and disaster recovery solutions for Managed Disks. It allows you to get the changes between two  snapshots of the same disk, thus copying only changed data between two snapshots across regions, reducing time and cost for backup and disaster recovery. Read more about incremental snapshots [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disks-incremental-snapshots)

In this sample, we demonstrate the following:
- How to fetch incremental snapshots created for a disk in an Azure resource group
- How to generate shared access signature (SAS) URI for a snapshot for getting the changes since the last snapshot 
- How to download the first incremental snapshot as a base blob in another region. 
- How to copy only the changes since the last snapshot to the base blob. 
- How to create snapshots on the base blob after the changes are copied. These snapshots represent your point in time backup of the disk in another region. 

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have a Microsoft Azure subscription you can
get a FREE trial account [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330212).
- Use the steps [here](https//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a service principal in your subscription. Please note down the tenantId, applicationId and secret key for the service principal. It will be used in the sample
- Use the article [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disks-incremental-snapshots) to create incremental snapshots for a managed disk that you want to backup
- Create an Azure Storage account where you want to store your backups using the article [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal)
- Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-sas-create-dotnet) to generate the SAS token of the storage account 

## Setup

- Clone the repository using the following command:
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/managed-disks-dotnet-backup-with-incremental-snapshots.git
- Open the BackupManagedDisksWithIncrementalSnapshots.sln file in the root folder in Visual Studio 
- Build the solution using Visual Studio

## Runnning the sample

- Set the value of following variables in the Main method in Program.cs file
  * subscriptionId: The subscription Id where the incremental snapshots of the managed disk are created
  * resourceGroupName: The resource group name where incremental snapshots of the managed disks are created
  * diskName: The name of the disk that is backed up with incremental snapshots in the source region
  * targetStorageAccountName: The name of the storage account in the target region where incremental snapshots from source region are copied to a base blob. 
  * targetStorageAccountSASToken: The shared access signatures(SAS) token of the storage account
  * targetContainerName: The name of the container where base blob is stored on the target storage account
  * targetBaseBlobName: The name of the base VHD (blob) used for storing the backups in the target storage account 
          

## Key concepts

Provide users with more context on the tools and services used in the sample. Explain some of the code that is being used and how services interact with each other.
